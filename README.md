Scripts and data for re-generating results from the TDM manuscript.

Use run_experiments.R to regenerate the analyses from
[Thompson et al.](https://peerj.com/preprints/1460/).

We are using Git Large File Storage to store gene expression data. You will
need to [install the client](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if you do not already
have it installed. Once you install the client, run `git lfs pull` in the
clone to retrieve the datasets. After retrieving the datasets, using
run_experiments.R will regenerate the results.
