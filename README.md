Scripts and data for re-generating results from the TDM manuscript.

Use run_experiments.R to regenerate the analyses from
[Thompson et al.](https://peerj.com/preprints/1460/).

We are using Git Large File Storage to store gene expression data. You will
need to [install the client](https://git-lfs.github.com/) if you do not already
have it installed. Once you install the client, run `git lfs pull` in the
clone to retrieve the datasets. After retrieving the datasets, using
run_experiments.R will regenerate the results.

This requires the following R & Bioconductor packages be installed:

	* ggplot2
	* reshape2
	* Hmisc
	* data.table
	* scales
	* sdcMicro
	* flexclust
	* fpc
	* corrplot
	* ape
	* cluster
	* plyr
	* dplyr
	* devtools
	* quantro
	* preprocessCore
	* gridExtra
	* huge
	* caret
	* limma
	* glmnet
	* e1071
	* stringr
	* gdata
	* binr
   	* cowplot

One github package is required:

    library("devtools")
    install_github(repo = "quantroSim", username = "stephaniehicks")

By default, all input data is expected to be in this local directory and
normalized data and figure output is within this directory as well. If you'd
like to change this behavior, modify "directories.R".
